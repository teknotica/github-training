## Running the project in your machine
  
- Clone the project in your laptop. Save it in a directory you can easily find (E.g.: Documents)
- Open up that folder in Visual Code
- Open the terminal window in Visual Code (Control + `) or through the top menu (Terminal > New Terminal)
- Install the project dependencies. Type the following on the terminal `npm install`
- Run the local server `npm run start`
  
A new browser window should open up automatically after this ⚡️🤓
