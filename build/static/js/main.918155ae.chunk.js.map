It has a stocky build,\n      well developed hind legs, rounded ears, and a short, broad head. Its\n      musculoskeletal system was originally adapted for terrestrial bipedal\n      saltation but over its evolution its system has been built for arboreal\n      locomotion.[7] Although looking rather like a very small kangaroo, it can\n      climb small trees and shrubs up to 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in).[8] Its coarse\n      fur is a grizzled brown colour, fading to buff underneath. The quokka is\n      known to live for an average of ten years.[9]\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Quokkas have a promiscuous mating system.[10] After a month of gestation,\n      females give birth to a single baby called a joey. Females can give birth\n      twice a year and produce approximately seventeen joeys during their\n      lifespan.[9] The joey lives in its mother’s pouch for six months. Once it\n      leaves the pouch, the joey relies on its mother for milk for two more\n      months and is fully weaned approximately eight months after birth.[9]\n      Females sexually mature after roughly 18 months.[11] When a female quokka\n      with a joey in her pouch is pursued by a predator, she may drop her baby\n      onto the ground; the joey produces noises, which may serve to attract the\n      predator’s attention while the mother escapes.[12]\n    </p>\n    <h2>Ecology</h2>\n    <p>\n      <img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/y3dcs269\" alt=\"\" />\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the wild, its roaming is restricted to a very small range in the\n      South-West of Western Australia, with a number of small scattered\n      populations. There is one large population on Rottnest Island and a\n      smaller population on Bald Island near Albany. The islands are free of\n      certain predators such as foxes and cats. On Rottnest, quokkas are common\n      and occupy a variety of habitats ranging from semi-arid scrub to\n      cultivated gardens.[16] Prickly Acanthocarpus plants, which are\n      unaccommodating for humans and other relatively large animals to walk\n      through, provide their favorite daytime shelter for sleeping.[17]\n      Additionally, they are known for their ability to climb trees.[9]\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Home;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nconst Resources = () => (\n  <div className=\"page\">\n    <h1>Quokkas resources</h1>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Hayward, M.
